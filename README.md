Manipulated the DOM to create a dynamically created navigation menu, and highlight active sections


## Sections  

More sections can be added by simply adding/placing it among the other sections in the HTML file, and by creating data to represent the section you add to the `sections` array in the JavaScript file.  

It would be best to copy one of the already existing `sections`, keeping the already defined classes, and then format it according to your needs.
